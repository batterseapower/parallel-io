-- | Parallelism combinators with an implicit global thread-pool.
--
-- The most basic example of usage is:
--
-- > main = parallel_ [putStrLn "Echo", putStrLn " in parallel"] >> stopGlobalPool
--
-- Make sure that you compile with @-threaded@ and supply @+RTS -N2 -RTS@
-- to  the generated Haskell executable, or you won't get any parallelism.
--
-- If you plan to allow your worker items to block, then you should read the documentation for 'extraWorkerWhileBlocked'.
--
-- The "Control.Concurrent.ParallelIO.Local" module provides a more general
-- interface which allows explicit passing of pools and control of their size.
-- This module is implemented on top of that one by maintaining a shared global thread
-- pool with one thread per capability.
